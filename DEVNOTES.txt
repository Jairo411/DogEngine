-Currently looking at every .cpp and .h file that I've created, I've improved appond my coding skills and knowing myself I probably have alot of left over variables and 
not deleted pointers. 
-The MAIN FOCUS:
Okay so serializer class being you're main focus is a huge ass lie, what you need, 
is to decompartamentalize your GameEngine Functionality, Like your timer is a part of your Engine but should
be only created once. Your serializer, Renderer and Window, will at somepoint need to be changed in some way, or
properities will need to be accessed at somepoint, so this in essences is a group of classes that need to be created once, 
while also having the added ability of "gobal reach". 
So to summerize this all, I need my GameEngine Functionality to be seperated even more and have clear destinction between the "Main" Engine, 
and all the Engine Components. 
is currently my serializer class, as it's more wonkey then the rest of my code.
