NOTE
Because you are using SDL2 which doesn't have a 3D rendering API for you use, 
but I could imagine if you set up the math properly by your own means you
could create your own rendering frame work through the use of SDL2. 

Because you're engine logic is every different from your SDL2 to OpenGL to
Vulkan logic, I decided that it would be best to separate all scenes into 
there respective graphics API usage, for easy usage. 

I think porting over one scene from OpenGL to Vulkan is actually possible and
probably pretty easy in comparsion to any of the 2 serious graphics APIs to
each other, but porting to SDL2, bro, I don't even know how to articulate the
pain the ass that would be.

So yeah, different scene folders for different Graphics APIs.
