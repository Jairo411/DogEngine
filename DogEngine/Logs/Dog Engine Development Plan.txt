I've essentially worked on this project on and off for the past 5 something years. It is time to finish this. For whatever reason it took you this 
long, whatever it is okay. But just one thing is clear this is the final stretch, no more procrastinating on the game engine. It is time to build this 
thing once and for all and it is time to build this thing good. 

What is good? 
good is in retrospect to what is slightly outside of your current ability and the time you have to build this game engine. You need to get outside of your comfort zone in order to learn 
and grow more.

The current goal of my game engine 

-Building an application ready with game objects that I can move in the game world. 

In specifics of what I need to do in order to develop this 
-Vulkan Graphics API in order to have objects be render in the game world.
-fmod so that my game engine supports sound. 
-pugixml so that my game engine is able to serialize and deserialize information.
-DearGUI so that my game engine has UI.

This is my minimal viable product.

Current focus: Learning how to build a triangle in vulkan

Learning how to build a triangle in Vulkan so that I am able to implement the Vulkan graphics pipline in the DogEngine.
