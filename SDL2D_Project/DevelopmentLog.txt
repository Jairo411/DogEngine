(2022/8/16)This is the first entry in the development Log.
*Quick Guide lines* 
This .txt file will only contain information about what needs to be worked on
and the result of that work. Might create another .txt to describe more in detail what has
been worked on and what will be implemented in the future. But I believe that
keeping the task simples will make the development easier for myself.

(2022/8/16) DAY 1 

TIMER.H
-Timer interface needs to worked on, way too bloated.

-alot of functions and alot of variables that might be assigned or not. Do not
know.Interface is way to big and needs to specialize a bit more. 
 
-Might need to create different types of time interfaces. 

VEC.H 
-Suppose to be some sort of a math interface only supports 2D math with some
overloaded operators, knowing what I know now, there is probably a better way
to implement this. 

Converter.H 
-Remove it

Input folder (ALL classes) 
-Don't remember that it works, should implement this feature as soon as
possible. 
 
EngineSeralizer.H 
-Has alot of valueable comments, I don't think it works the best as it should
from what I remember. Leave this as one of the last things to polish. 

DogEngine.H
-Kinda bloated(might just be that way because of all the manager classes you
have. 
-You have a thread function, that's just kinda shoved right in there. 

AI folder (ALL  classes) 
-Yeah those interfaces have been broken for awhile.. 

Design Patter folder(ALL classes) 
-Don't really have an exact idea what you're going do to it. But its
implemented into your engine and it shouldn't be at least not the way it
currently is. 

AutoManager.H 
-Not a real interface, just something you created to get grades. 

Animator folder(ALL classes) 
-just a bloaded mess. 
  
 Window folder(ALL classes) 
-Bloated needs reworking.
