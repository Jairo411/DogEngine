# Update 
I've currently suspended my development on the dog engine. I've decided to switch my focus onto becoming a full stack web developer. This doesn't mean that I don't plan to ever work on this project again, because it isn't finish by any means. But then rather hide my unfinished worked, I'll leave it for the public to see the effort I put into this project, during my years studying game development as a student at humber college 2017-2022.

# Description
The Dog Engine, is a  game engine that I started working on during 2019 in my days as a college student at humber college. I have gone through many trails and tribulations trying to finish this game engine, as well as many refactors. I am currently working on this engine again, to display what I've learn up to so far in my journey of programming for 6 years now. My plan is to have acouple stable releases of my game engine before I finish working on this project.

## DogEngine Highlights
* Entity Component System 
* Usage of Modern C++ features, up to C++ 20 
* High Performance Timer 
* Game Engine Design Patterns, specifically (Game Loop)
* SDL2 Rendering 
* The learning I gain, from trying to build this game engine by myself.
