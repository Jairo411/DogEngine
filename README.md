## About The Dog Engine
---
The Dog Engine, is a engine that I made during 2019 days as a student at humber college. At first, this engine was made to be a final presentation of what I had learned at humber throughout the years, which it did end up being. But I managed to use this engine, while building it, for completing certain assignments. During this process, I learned a lot through the process of building the engine as time went on. 

The engine now will display certain assignments, that I did for school with the technologies and designs I used to make those programs.
